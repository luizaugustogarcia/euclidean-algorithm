# Complexity analysis of the Euclidean Algorithm

Demonstration, in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), that the [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) can be efficiently used to compute the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two numbers *a* and *b* in *O(log(min(a,b)))* steps.

This project was implemented as part of my undergradute scientific initiation program in [formal software verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification), supervised by [Flávio L. C. Moura](http://flaviomoura.info/).
